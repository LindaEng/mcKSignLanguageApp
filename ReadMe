Project Description:

Description:

Your team will be building a full stack application that will train a tensor flow model to be able to identify the ASL alphabet.

RECOMMENDED TECHNOLOGIES:


Development:
Node.js
Jest
Express
Sequelize
React
Redux
Postgresql or Sqlite
OAuth
Docker
Diagram.db

Tensor Flow


Project Management:
Github Projects
Trello
UX/ UI:
Figma
Adobe XD
Canva






RECOMMENDED TIMELINE  :





Role assignments - [ Project Lead ] 
The Project Lead will decide on an agile work style, and determine their roles for each team. A product owner will check their colleagues’ availability and pick the best people for the project while also providing them with the necessary tools and resources.

The team will decide how they want to structure their standups and agile sprints. A team contract is expected to be formed. The Project Lead is responsible for checking in with leads for each team with separate standups.




Project decision 
The Project Lead will document what the group has decided upon for their product. The Project Lead can adjust the amount of days for each subsequent section.
 
Project scoping and initiation -
User stories will be created for the MVP
A Github project board will be created, all members from each team will decide on how to structure their tickets and assignments.






UI wireframes / design work - [UX/UI] 
A visual mockup will be designed. The design should be responsive. A wireframe is expected to be developed.
Recommended tool: Figma, Adobe XD

Database Schema - [SWE] 
A database schema is designed and decided. 
Recommended tool: Diagram.db






Development Stage - [SWE / UI]
At this stage, the engineering team will be building out the MVP and writing tests. The SWE team will be in consistent communication with the UX/UI team to make sure both teams are aligned with their expectations.

The goal is to build the bare functionality of the product by the end of the first iteration or sprint. Additional features and tweaks can be added in later iterations. This stage is a cornerstone of Agile software development, enabling developers to create working software quickly and make improvements to satisfy the client.





Release:
[SWE / Data]
The product is almost ready for release. But first, the quality assurance team needs to perform some tests to ensure the software is fully functional. If potential bugs or defects are detected, the developers will address them swiftly. When all of this is complete, the product’s final iteration can then be released into production.

[Digital Marketing]
Graphics/ visuals of the application are advertised. 


Maintenance:
The software will now be fully deployed and made available to users. This action moves it into the maintenance phase. During this phase, the software development team will provide ongoing support to keep the system running smoothly and resolve any new bugs. They will also be on hand to offer additional training to users and ensure they know how to use the product. Over time, new iterations can take place to refresh the existing product with upgrades and additional features. 
[Sprint end]





Example MVP:

Home page
Dictionary
Flash Cards
Training Room

Homepage: 
Three buttons
Dictionary, Flash Cards, Training Room
Dictionary:
Parent component: view with all signs
Redux store: should bring in all the image files of each sign via mapStateToProps

Child Component: A single view of each sign
Pass down props from parent component to child component [image + Alphabet]



Flash Cards:
Redux Store: bring in all ASL alphabet using mapStateToProps.
Component should randomize a card.




Training Room:
